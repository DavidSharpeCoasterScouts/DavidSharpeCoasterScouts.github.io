        <h1><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>David Sharpe's Basic Webpage</strong></span></h1>
        <p>Howdy everybody and welcome to my first ever basic web page. This web page is designed to introduce you to some parts of my past, share with you what I'm doing currently, introduce you to my YouTube<br>
         channel, and how I will use lessons and code from my web development course to develop a website that will educate others about my YouTube channel and the person who creates it.</p>
        <h2><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>The Origins of Coaster Scouts</strong></span></h2>
        <h3><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>My Expereinces with Autism</strong></span></h3>
        <p>When I was very young, I was diagnosed with autism, a social and emotional disorder that made it difficult for me to talk, interact, or socialize with other people. When my parents recieved my <br>
        diagnosis, they worked with me to train myself how to properly socialize with other people. I would spend a potion of everyday learning social skills from one on one interactions with a private <br>
        speech therapist who would consistantly work with me within my family's household so that I could learn how to maintain eye contact, how to read facial exressions so that I knew how a person was <br>
        feeling, knowing the propler time to step into a conversation, recognise when people don't want to talk with you, and many other skills that I needed to learn. Moreover, I would often go to the <br>
        University of Missouri's Thompson Center to revieve additional social training and check up on my abilities to socialize with others on a regular basis. In fact, the Thompson Center will survey <br>
        me once in a while to help them understand my expereince with autism and help others who also have autism. Today, I socialize as well as a person who doesn't have autism. In fact, those who have <br>
        learned or known that I have autism can hardly tell that I have autism.</p>
        <h3><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>My Expereince with Fear and How I Overcame It</strong></span></h3>
        <p>However, my time training and learning how to socialize with other people was also a time when fear completely controlled my life. Any type of activity, event, or excursion outside of my comfort<br>
    zone was met with extreme resistance and I never dared more a muscle if I were to go into a place that I wasn't comfotable for me to go into. I remember on time when I was downstairs of one of the <br>
    University Missouri buildings and was so scared about what was on the next floor that I paniced and cried saying to my therapist that <q>I don't want to go up there.</q> This fundamental deer in the<br>
    headlights feeling controlled me for years until one fateful day in the summer of 2013. My family and I were on a family vacation and had plans to visit an amusement park called <q>Worlds of Fun</q><br>
    for a day. Before we went into the park, my mother turned back to me and my brother and said <q>you are going to ride a roller coaster before we leave today.</q> This statement put myself into a full<br>
    panic and I wasn't ready to try something as scary as riding a roller coaster. Fortunately, my mother allowed me to choose whichever roller coaster I needed to ride that day and so I decided to ride <br>
    a wooden roller coaster called <q>Timber Wolf.</q>While I was in line for the ride, my nerves were at peak anxiousness as I was physically shaking in fear when I saw the coaster's lift hill and as I <br>
    got closer and closer to boarding the coaster's train. As me and my brother boarded the Timber Wolf coaster train, I knew there was no going back, I had to see this through. As we rolled out of the<br>
    station and rode around Tomber Wolf's ride layout, I actually found joy in riding Tomber Wolf rather than being afraid of it. It was as if my wall of fear was shattered and all that was left was nothing<br>
    but pure joy. As I got off of Timber Wolf and met back with my mother, I told her how much fun I had riding Timber Wolf. That was great for my mother ot hear because he made me ride another roller coaster<br>
    after that. With Timber Wolf finished, I decided to ride their second wooden roller coaster named <q>Prowler</q> and ever since that expereince, I've never let fear control my life ever again.</p>
    <h3><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>What I'm Doing Today</strong></span></h3> 
    <p>Fast forward to today, I've been riding as many roller coasters as I can. I regularly visit the amusement parks of Six Flags St. Louis, Worlds of Fun, and Silver Dollar City multiple times througout the year.<br>
    I've also been going to different amusement parks across the midwest such as Cedar Point, Kings Island, Kentucky Kingdom, Beech Bend, and Holiday World. All of these amusment parks are great places to visit and <br>
    I've ridden sixty four (64) different roller coasters throughout my lifetime. I also intend to visit one new amusment park each year because I want to expereince new rides, places, and parks that I've never been<br>
    to before. I'm also a member of a coaster enthusiast group called <q>The American Coaster Enthusiasts.</q> I've been a member of their <q>Heart of America</q> group for a year now and I'm grateful to find and <br>
    interact with people who share a passion for roller coasters as much as I do. Unfortunately I haven't been able to join any of their meet ups due to college and part time work, but I'm doing my best to meet and <br>
    interact with memebrs of The American Coaster Enthusiasts as soon as possible. In fact, I'm planning on going to an event called <q>Coaster Christmas</q> which takes place next Saturday at Silver Dollar City. <br>
    In this event, I will be able to re-ride all the roller coasters at Silver Dollar Ciy before the park opens up to the public and will see a live showing of a christma classic <q>A Christmas Carol</q> some point<br>
    during the day.</p>
    <h3><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>What is Coaster Scouts?</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Coaster Scouts is my personal YouTube channel that I use to share my love for roller coasters to others who may or may not have the same love for roller coasters as I do. The best way to describe my channel is <br>
    by sharing with you my channel's description. 
<blockquote><q><em>Howdy, everyone. My name is David Sharpe and I am an avid roller coaster enthusiast ever since I rode Timber Wolf at Worlds of Fun back in 2013. A lot has changed since then, but now I am ready to <br>
            develop my own YouTube channel to share my enthusiasm for roller coasters in a manner that other roller coaster channels don't. Some of the things I do include creating music videos about amusement <br>
            parks, show my admiration for other YouTubers by creating YouTuber Roller Coasters, sometimes make a coaster enthusiast meme video, and create videos that are fun for me to create and share. All of <br>
            which is centered by two ideals, to help others develop courage and to build a community with fellow coaster enthusiasts. I post videos on Mondays a few weeks apart due to my need to spend more time <br>
            on college and part-time work. If you enjoy the content that I make, please like, share, comment, and subscribe so that you can stay tuned for future content. For Courage, For Community, The Coaster <br>
            Scouts.</em></q></blockquote>

    <h3><span style="color:#d63232"><strong>Developing a Coaster Scouts Website</strong></span></h3>
    For my final project, I'm interested in developing a website that can help people who use my website learn a variety of facts and stories about my life so that they can understand the creator behind the YouTube <br>
    channel and my core values for creating content on YouTube. Some of those apsects have been shown to you in this webpage but other aspects that I'd like to add to this webpage would include:
    <ul>
        <li>A list of my personal favorite roller coasters</li>
        <li>A media page to share the footage I film at amusement parks</li>
        <li>More detailed graphics to make my web pages look better</li>
        <li>Add a variety of images to show viewers who I looked like at certain points of my life</li>
        <li>Add hyperlinks to the site so that viewers can see some of the videos I created</li>
        <li>Provide a full contact page where viewers can contant me by which ever means works best for them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm looking forward to continue using the coding lessons from my web development course to develop a wonderful website and I hope that this basic web page of mine is one step closer towards that goal.</p>
