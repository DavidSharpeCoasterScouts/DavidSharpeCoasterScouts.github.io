        <h1>Evaluation of The Coaster Scouts Website</h1>
        <h2>Evaluator Participants</h2>
        <p>My first website evaluator is a teenage boy named Brian. He is a friend of my little brother and was eager and helpful enough to take some time out of his school day to conduct an evaluation for my website. Brian represents the use case of those who watch YouTube on a regular basis but are not into the roller coasters/theme parks as much as I do. Those who do watch YouTube often tend to be around Brian’s age and its important to learn more about how one part of my intended audience will see the website I will soon complete. In Brian’s case, my website was tested using a cable modem internet connection to a HP laptop that runs Windows 10 using the Google Chrome internet browser.</p>
        <p>My second website evaluator is named Alex. I found Alex on a group Instagram messaging center that was centered around roller coasters and amusement parks. Alex’s social media account is called Coasterlimits and is a coaster enthusiast like me. His input on my website is extremely crucial because my website is dedicated to people like Alex, to those who live roller coasters and would love to learn more about my experiences with roller coasters. Alex tested my website using a cable modem internet connection that connected to a Lenovo laptop that runs Windows 10 using the Google Chrome internet browser.</p>
        <p>My third and final website evaluator is a lady named Mary. Mary is one of the graduate students at the University of Missouri and my mother was more than willing to get me to contact her about my website evaluation and get enough evaluations to complete this assignment. Mary is more towards the business side of things and her input was helpful in recognizing how parents of my intended audience might view my content on my website and could show be how advertisers, and marketers might see me and the things I do for my YouTube Channel. Mary tested out my website using and institutional internet connection that connected to a Dell Latitude E5470 that runs Windows 7 Enterprise using the Google Chrome internet browser. </p>
        <h2>Summary of Evaluator’s Responses and Comments</h2>
        <p>Most of the sentiments made by Brian, Alex and Mary were highly complimentary of my work on my website. All three participants remarked on how the navigation bar was intuitive, easy to understand, and the tabs on the navigation are self-explanatory to those who haven’t seen the website before while also noting the clear text and contrast between the text and the background of the website’s pages. The three participants also noted how all links were functional in the pages I completed and had a definite purpose to them. One of the participants even noted that they linked the dropdown menu once you scroll to the buttons in the navigation bar, which made me feel pretty good about how I made the pilot website.</p>
        <p>However, there were some suggestions Brian and Alex made in their evaluations that hinted at how I could make my website better. The most impactful suggestion from one of the two evaluators is that I should add more exciting content to my home page whether it be adding some more exciting roller coaster pictures or pictures of myself. This is because my evaluator believed that my fan’s first impression will be made when they reach my website’s home site first and the current home page I have now doesn’t sit well with his expectations. Another suggestion made by one of the evaluators noted that it would be a good idea to add the phrase “all photos taken by ________” so that the website’s content credibility is further established. Furthermore, one of the evaluators noted that they didn’t think there was a difference between the Want to Collab page and the Contact me Page and would be good if both pages were just one page altogether. If you would like to know more about my evaluator’s responses, you can find them in the links below.</p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Based on the responses I received, my pilot website dues support the three use cases I outlined in my design document. The Coaster Scouts website is meant to serve as the official website of the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel, sharing the important information about the Coaster Scouts Channel and the creator behind the channel. For the pilot website, my evaluators noted how coaster enthusiasts and new viewers alike were able to receive important information in the specified coaster credits, personal favorite roller coasters, and social media pages remarking how the pages helped them understand how many roller coasters I’ve been on, what types of roller coasters I’ve been on, which ones out of my entire coaster credits list are my favorite roller coasters, and the platforms I use to connect with others on social media. However, some of the areas on the navigation bar are not completed yet and areas such as Archives, About, and Coaster Polls were inaccessible to my website evaluators. This is mostly because those pages haven’t been created yet and would need to be completed for my website to be fully complete and accessible to my use cases. This is the only issue I have with the pilot website and I look further to develop the pages and resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2>Recommended/Planned Changes to My Website’s Design</h2>
        <p>From these evaluations, there are a couple of changes recommended by my evaluators that I plan on making to my website to make it more engaging for first time visitors and add credibility to the content/multimedia of my website. As noted in the “Summary of Evaluator’s Responses and Comments” section of this report, one of my website evaluators noted that it would be a good idea to add more exciting content to my home page whether it be adding some more exciting roller coaster pictures or pictures of myself along with adding a little more information on the home page describing what the website is about to the user. I plan on implementing these suggestions because it would help users understand why my website exists and make a good first impression to users who see my website for the very first time. I expect these changes to add more enticement to the user to look around the rest of the website’s pages and will help users understand why there is a Coaster Scouts website to begin with.</p>
        <p>Another suggestion made by one of my website’s evaluators that I thought would be beneficial to add to the website is the phrase “all photos taken by Coaster Scouts” on pages that have content created by myself. I believe having this phrase on pages that have my content will give me credit for the media on the page and will let users know that the media on the page was made by me. This will help increase the credibility of my website and note all important parties who contribute to the content and multimedia on my website, which includes myself and any creative commons media. As a result, some of the users might be surprised at the media I have implemented into the website and remark at how vast and unique it is compared to media on similar websites. </p>
        <p>However, the last suggestion made by one of my website evaluators will not be implemented into my final website because it’s meant to be for a specific audience. My evaluator stated that he would be better if my Want to Collab page and Contact Me page were all in one page instead of two separate pages. While I do see some benefits of having those two pages together, I will keep the tow pages separate because my Want to Collab page is meant to encourage fellow content creators to collaborate with the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel and fulfill my third use case of the website while the Contact Me page is meant for anyone to contact me about anything. While I have not directly collaborated with other content creators yet, I plan on expanding the Want to Collab page with content creators I’ve collaborated in the past to help future collaborators know who I’ve worked with before and would further encourage future collaborators to contact me because I’ve had experience collaborating with fellow content creators. </p>
        <h2>Reflection of The Evaluation Process</h2>
        <p>My evaluation process for my website this week was helpful in identifying the strengths of my pilot website and addressing areas where I can improve what I already have and make my final website even more spectacular. My website evaluation surveys from my three evaluators really gave me a good sense of what my potential audience thinks about the content I have on the website, how well my website’s layout is, and address areas that I didn’t even think about until they brought it up to light. Brian was great at showing me what fellow YouTube viewers might think about my website when they visit it and Alex was great at addressing how to tailor my site towards coaster enthusiasts. I also appreciate the comments made by Vladimir and my other classmates for helping me see the errors in my pilot website and suggestions in helping me load the pages faster. With this information, I look to address my HTML and CSS errors while also adding more information and media to the home page and credit my own media in any and all pages that have my media in them.  This will certainly help me create a website that is more in tune with my target audience and improve my website’s appearance to my users and specific use cases. I’d like to thank all of those who took part in this evaluation process and I look forward to making this site better than when I last made it.</p>
