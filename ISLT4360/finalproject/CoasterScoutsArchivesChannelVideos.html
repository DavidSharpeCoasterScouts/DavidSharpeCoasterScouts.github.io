                          <h1>Channel Videos</h1>
                          <p>The Coaster Scouts YouTube channel creates a variety of videos that share my love of roller coasters in ways that works best for me. Some of the videos on the channel can be seen in a particular video series or genre that is intended for a specific audience.  However, new videos being made on the channel won't necessarily fall into a particual series or genre because I want to make videos that have intrinsic value to me and to my audience. So with that being said, I'd like to share with you some of the videos I've made in the past to help you know what are some of the videos I created for the channel and how I intend to make videos from here on out.</p>
                          <h3>Tall Man's Perspective</h3>
                          <P>Tall Man's Perspective was my way of reviewing/sharing my thoughts and opinions about specific roller coasters and amusement parks. The series began with the third video upload to the channel titled <q>American Thunder a Tall Man's Perspective</q> and has continued on through six more videos throughout the early months of the channel. Despite the video series's intended purpose, I found that making these videos was getting too repetitive and it wasn't a topic that I enjoyed doing, so I decided to stop making Tall Man's Perspective videos in favor of new and more interesting content. Perhaps a revamp of the series with a new layout and more attention to creativity could possibly bring the series back, but there are some other things that I'd like to do first before reworking my Tall Man's Persepctive Series. One Tall Man's Perspective series video I'd like to share with you is my take on the Worlds of Fun Boomerang in the video titled <q>Worlds of Fun Boomerang A Tall Man's Perspective.</q> While many in the coaster community really don't like these coaster models, I thought that the Worlds of Fun Boomerang wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I still didn't like it but it wasn't the worst roller coaster I've been on.</P>

                          <h3>Roller Coaster/Amusement Park Music Videos</h3>
                          <p>These videos have been more in tune with what I am creating on the channel nowadays. I am a fervent listener of music and I found it quite enjoyable to connect my passion for roller coasters with my connections in music to create emotional and enjoyable roller coaster/amusement park music videos. My biggest inspiration for this was when I watched a video named <q>This is Cedar Point 2013 mix</q> made by the channel Pure Thrills. I loved how the music and video clips synced up with each other as the video resonated with me a lot since the first time I watched it. In fact that video was the thing that pushed me to visit Cedar Point for the first time and I still to this day listen to <q>This is What it Feels Like(Extended Mix)</q> by Armin Van Burren as my personal Cedar Point Theme Song. This gave me the idea of making a music video about my time at Kentucky Kindom and since then, I've been looking forward to create more music videos after each trip I take outside of my home state to capture all the wonders I expereinced on that trip. My most recent music video was centered around the out of state trip I took in the summer or 2018 when I came to visit Kings Island for the first time and revisit Cedar Point for round two. I had a lot of fun greating this video and it really captured the fun and enjoyment I had during that time.</p>

                          <h3>Roller Coater/amusement Park Meme Videos</h3>
                          <p>Sometimes I like to have a good laugh and every so often, I like to make some meme videos just to make a good laugh and have some fun for a while. Memes are the fastest way of getting a message into someones head and I've come to respect and embrace memes and meme culture through the careful teachings of a YouTuber called Emplemon. My most recent meme video takes a jab at some of the most popular and rising creators in the Roller Coaster Enthusiast community on YouTube. Some of the people I feature in the video include Coaster Studios, Koaster Kids, Coaster Fanatics, Rob's Rides, etc. All of which are highly commendable and have earned thier place in this video and as members of the coaster enthusiast commumity on YouTube.</p>

                          <h3>YouTuber Roller Coasters</h3>
                          <p>YouTuber Roller Coasaters began as my way to share my appreciation for some of my favorite creators on the YouTube platform by creating roller coasters in a roller coaster sumilator titled <q>No Limits 2</q> and share with those highlighted creators all videos and photos of the coaster to let him/her/them know how much I enjoy their content. The most interesting and fun YouTuber Roller Coaster I've made to date was my first one, an Intamin launch coaster that was meant to pay omage to the <q>Content Cop</q> series and series creator Idubbbz. I look forward to creating more YouTuber Roller Coasters in the future and I hope those who are highlighted in these coasters recognize how much I admire and respect what they do.</p>

                          <h3>Other Notable Videos</h3>
                          <p>Another thing I'd like to note is that whenever I know where I'm going to a certain amusement park outside of my home state of Missouri, I'll often make a small video telling my audience where I will be going and what date and time I will be there. This type of video helped me break out of my regular routine videos that I made at the start of the channel and began the trend of making videos for the sake of making fun and interesting videos. The best one out of this type of video came when I announced that I was going to be at Kings Island and Cedar Point on August 1st and August 3rd of 2018. It was a breath of fresh air for me and it will still be that way throughout the next years of my channel. I hope to meet as many people as I can on my trips and learn to appreciate what other parks have to offer.</p>
