<h1>David Sharpe's Design Document</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This website will serve as the official website of the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel. It will provide regular YouTube viewers with background information about the creator behind Coaster Scouts. This will help viewers learn/know about the creator behind Coaster Scouts and why he creates videos on the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel. It will provide coaster enthusiasts with detailed statistics about Coaster Scouts including a list of roller coasters Coaster Scouts has been on in his lifetime, photos and videos from parks Coaster Scouts has visited, and a personal ranking of Coaster Scouts’ favorite roller coasters. This will help coaster enthusiasts know how versed Coaster Scouts is with the coaster enthusiast community and compare their coaster stats and favorite roller coasters with Coaster Scouts’ stats and favorite roller coasters to find similarities in favorite coasters or in stats. It will provide viewers with several methods of contact information where viewers both inside and outside of the coaster community can contact Coaster Scouts personally. This will help fans of Coaster Scouts and people in the media directly connect with Coaster Scouts and communicate with him about whatever the viewer would like to talk with Coaster Scouts. It will provide fans and newcomers of the Coaster Scouts’ website with social media posts and videos. This will help fans and newcomers know what Coaster Scouts is doing in the current day and recent months and stay up to date on when and where Coaster Scouts will be in the short-term future.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p><strong>Use 1: </strong>A coaster Enthusiast is interested in learning about the Coasters Coaster Scouts has been on and the parks Coaster Scouts has visited in his lifetime. The coaster enthusiasts will click on the Coaster Stats tab on the navigation bar to access Coaster Scouts’ number of coaster credits, list of amusement parks Coaster Scouts has visited in his lifetime, and a ranked list of Coaster Scouts’ personal favorite roller coasters. They can also click on the Coaster Polls tab to engage in regular coaster discussion in a variety of roller coaster topics. These polls will be changed regularly with new topics for coaster enthusiasts to discuss almost every single week. Moreover, coaster enthusiasts can click on the park footage tab to view pictures and videos made by Coaster Scouts to see what the parks Coaster Scouts has visited look like. This will help coaster enthusiasts see the parks Coaster Scouts has visited over his lifetime and get an idea of what the park is like from the footage Coaster Scouts captures at the parks he visits. Two of the websites I researched (<a href="https://newjerseycoasters.net/">NewJerseyCoasters</a> and <a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot</a>) offer coaster enthusiasts with a detailed list of roller coasters they have ridden in their lifetime while one other website (<a href="https://themeparkcrazy.com/">ThemeParkCrazy</a>) offer coaster enthusiasts with a new coaster poll each week for enthusiasts to interact and discuss with one another and four websites (<a href="https://www.koasterkids.com/">KoasterKids </a>, <a href="https://newjerseycoasters.net/">NewJerseyCoasters</a>, <a href="https://themeparkcrazy.com/">ThemeParkCrazy</a>, <a href="http://www.thecoasterguy.com/">TheCoasterGuy</a>) offer enthusiasts with photos and videos of the parks they go to and the people that are with them.</p>
<p><strong>Use 2: </strong>A Regular YouTube viewer has just stumbled onto the Coaster Scouts channel and goes to the Coaster Scouts website because he/she is interested in learning about the channel and the person who runs the channel. New Viewers can click on the about tab on the navigation bar to access information about the Coaster Scouts channel, the values the Coaster Scouts channel represents, and personal information about the creator and/or team behind the Coaster Scouts. This will give new viewers a more knowledgeable perspective of the Coaster Scouts channel and why the creator and/or team of creators create videos on the channel. These new viewers can also click on the Channel Vids in the about tab to see other videos Coaster Scouts has created and get and idea of how the creator of Coaster Scouts creates new videos. This is inspired by the <a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot</a> about page and the <a href="https://www.koasterkids.com/">KoasterKids</a> documentary film page as <a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot</a> shows the goals, creators, and aspirations for the channel while <a href="https://www.koasterkids.com/">Koaster Kids</a> offers a video that explains why he creates videos on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Use 3: </strong>Another roller coaster YouTube channel creator has been viewing some of the Coaster Scouts videos and would like to collaborate with Coaster Scouts on an upcoming video they are making for their roller coaster YouTube Channel. These YouTube Creators can click on the Want to Collab and Contact Us tabs to learn about other creators that have collaborated with the Coaster Scouts channel and contact the creator of Coaster Scouts directly to pitch their collab ideas and work together to create an interesting and engaging collaboration video together. This is inspired by the <a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot</a> site where he uses a collabs tab to show the YouTube channels <a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot</a> has collaborated with in the past and offers methods of communication to contact him about collaboration video ideas. Moreover, the <a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot</a> and <a href="https://newjerseycoasters.net/">NewJerseyCoasters</a> websites provide would be collaborators with explicit contact information to directly contact the creator and links to social media for more methods of communicating with the channel’s creator.</p>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>The target audience for this website will focus on coaster enthusiasts, fellow roller coaster content creators on YouTube, and new comers to the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel. This website will be ideal for those who have easy access to an internet connection, a computer, and are interested in learning more about the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel and what it represents. As the creator of the Coaster Scouts YouTube channel, I will make an orientation video centered around the Coaster Scouts website and guide users through various tabs of content the website will provide for coaster enthusiasts and new viewers alike. To get a common base of how I am going to design my website, I looked at five coaster enthusiast websites, four of which are centered around a specific roller coaster YouTube channel, to reference and utilize as good and bad website design. I explain more about these websites in the list below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.koasterkids.com/">KoasterKids:</a></strong> This website is great at providing coaster enthusiasts with up to date posts on social media, provide pictures of where Koaster Kids had visited along with the people they visit at a park, and offer an aspect of viewing some of the channel’s videos so that enthusiasts and new comers can understand the Koaster Kids channel and the values the channel represents. However, this website also falls short in not providing contact information for fellow creators, newcomers, or fans to directly communicate with Koaster Kids about their channel or listen to collaboration ideas from other coaster enthusiast channels.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://www.thecoasterguy.com/">TheCoasterGuy: </a></strong>This website does offer enthusiasts with photos and videos of where the website’s creator has been to over their lifetime. However, this website is an example of bad website design because the site is missing several areas that would help enthusiasts and new viewers learn about The Coaster Buy. Such areas missing include, a contact page for enthusiasts and new viewers to directly contact the creator and an about page that describes The Coater Guy and the goals he hopes to achieve with this website. There are also two navigation bars on the website which makes the site more cluttered than it needs to be.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://themeparkcrazy.com/">ThemeParkCrazy: </a></strong>This website’s good design is showcased in the vast archives of media created by Theme Park Crazy over the past few years which offer coaster enthusiasts a variety of places Theme Park Crazy has visited over the years and offers weekly polls for coaster enthusiasts to connect to a variety of topics like “what’s the best German roller coaster, What’s the best ride by Mack, What’s your favorite ride at Dorney Park, etc.” The site also provides quick links to Theme Park Crazy’s social media in the home page so that enthusiasts and viewers can interact with Theme Park Crazy and stay up to date on what Theme Park Crazy is doing recently. What this site fails to offer enthusiasts and new viewers alike is a dedicated contact webpage where they can directly communicate with Theme Park Crazy. This makes it more difficult for fellow coaster enthusiast YouTube creators to pitch collaboration video ideas and work together to create a collab video.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://newjerseycoasters.net/">NewJerseyCoasters: </a></strong>This website is similar in good design aspects with all these coaster enthusiast websites. This site offers a variety of photos of where New Jersey Coasters has been to, provides coaster enthusiasts with a detailed list of how many roller coasters New Jersey Coasters has been on, which coasters he has ridden, and the parks where the coasters are located, and provides viewers with links to New Jersey Coasters’ social media along with a contact webpage for fellow coaster enthusiast creators to directly pitch collaboration ideas to New Jersey Coasters and keep in contact with fellow coaster enthusiasts and new viewers alike. The only thing that is in bad design with this website is the about page of the website is tucked away in a bar at the top right-hand corner of the screen. The viewer isn’t explicitly shown that the three dotted box at the top right-hand corner is the about webpage of the website and it makes it harder for viewers to find it. Thereby, it’s difficult to gain information about New Jersey Coasters and is not user friendly for the viewers of the New Jersey Coasters website.</li>
    <li><Strong><a href="https://coasterbot.com/">CoasterBot: </a></Strong>This website is a great example of good website design for a roller coaster YouTube creator website. The website’s about page tells viewers the goals, aspirations, and people behind the channel giving them more knowledge about the channel in a clean and aesthetically pleasing format. The website’s more tab offers enthusiasts with a detailed coaster credit list that notes how many roller coasters Coaster Bot has been on, which coasters he has ridden, and the parks where the coasters are located. The more tab also has a collabs webpage that gives fellow coaster enthusiast YouTube creators the ability to know who has collaborated with Coaster Bot in the past and how to contact Coaster Bot to pitch collaboration ideas to Coaster bot by directly linking to his email account. Speaking of contact info, this website also offers a find us tab for new viewers and coaster enthusiasts alike to directly contact Coaster Bot. The only thing that’s missing from this site is a dedicated tab that shows pictures and videos from parks Coaster Bot has visited as well as a few videos from the Coaster Bot YouTube channel to help new viewers and coaster enthusiasts know the style Coaster Bot uses in his videos and how Coaster Bot creates videos for their YouTube channel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Needs Assessment</h3>
<p>In determining how a coaster enthusiast YouTube creator website would be useful for both coaster enthusiasts and YouTube viewers who are curious about the channel and creator, I surveyed four key stakeholders whom often view YouTube creators daily. Three of these stakeholders identify themselves as coaster enthusiasts while the forth stakeholder is a regular YouTube user who is not a coaster enthusiast. All the questions asked of them were required a short answer so that I could hear directly from the stakeholders their thoughts and ideas about the website with minimal bias input from myself.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Based on my results from my questionnaire, I will create a YouTube creator website that will include the following webpages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>About</strong>-This page will provide background information about the creator behind Coaster Scouts including history, channel goals, and channel values that tell viewers why the creator of Coaster Scouts creates videos on the channel.</li>
    <li><strong>Archives</strong>-This page will provide photos and videos taken by Coaster Scouts at parks Coaster Scouts has visited to showcase viewers the rides and sights of every amusement park Coaster Scouts has stepped foot in. This page will also provide viewers with a three to four videos from the Coaster Scouts channel to help viewers learn about the content created on the Coaster Scouts channel and some of the series found in the channel’s archive such as YouTuber Roller Coasters, Tall Man’s Perspective, Theme Park Music Videos, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Coaster Stats</strong>-This page will provide coaster enthusiasts and new viewers alike with a detailed coaster credit count that notes the amount of roller coasters Coaster Scouts has ridden, which coasters Coaster Scouts has ridden, and where those coasters are located. The page will also provide a ranked list of Coaster Scouts’ personal favorite roller coasters so that enthusiasts can see how their favorite coasters match up with Coaster Scout’s favorite coasters.</li>
    <li><strong>Coaster Polls</strong>-This page will provide coaster enthusiasts the ability to participate in bi weekly polls where they can note their favorite ride at an amusement park, favorite coaster in a certain country like Canada or Germany, and maybe potential video ideas in case the Coaster Scouts creator would like some more fan interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep in Touch</strong>-This page will serve as the means for connecting coaster enthusiasts, fellow coaster enthusiast YouTube creators, and new viewers to the Coaster Scouts creator and can directly communicate with the Coaster Scouts creator for any reason. This page will have three subpages that will focus on social media, want to collab, and Contact Me. The social media tab will provide users with all social media accounts used by Coaster Scouts such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Discord to connect with Coaster Scouts through those means. The want to collab tab will give fellow coaster enthusiast YouTube creators the assurance, prior collaborations with other coaster enthusiast YouTube creators, and means of contacting Coaster Scouts directly to pitch their collaboration video ideas to Coaster Scouts. The Contact Me tab will serve as a means of providing direct communication between the user and the creator of the Coaster Scouts. This tab will have a space where users will type in their name, email address, title, and message to the creator of the coaster scouts. Users will also be encouraged to contact the creator of Coasters Scouts for any reason to ensure that there’s no need for users to be extremely specific with their message to the creator of the Coaster Scouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The design elements and colors of each webpage will be congruent in all the pages on the website. Color choices and specific fonts will be connected to the colors and fonts used from the channel’s logo, thumbnails, and video production. More of that will be explained in the Color Scheme and Rationale section. All pages will also have a footer that will provide the website creator’s name, contact info, and late date the page was modified.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>I will use my own images and videos whenever possible. Any in all media on this website that is not of my own creation will be from creative commons and will be properly cited as warranted by the creator of the media. All pictures and videos in the website will be used to enhance the information presented in each page. This will make each webpage visually appealing to the user and help convey aspects of the content that words can’t describe.</p>
<h3>Color Scheme Rationale</h3>
<p>My desire for this website’s color scheme is to make the website aesthetically pleasing for various users while also making sure that the colors are congruent with the Coaster Scouts channel colors. To meet this need, my website’s colors will follow the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000">red</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #ffffff">white</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:#0006ed">blue</span></strong> pattern as presented with the Coaster Scouts channel. The background of the website will be white with the navigation buttons having a blue color with white words and the subpage list of the navigation buttons have a red color with white words. The text of the website will be set in the Oswald font, as seen in the headers of this document, so that the text in the website is congruent with the text used in the Coaster Scouts YouTube Channel.</p>
