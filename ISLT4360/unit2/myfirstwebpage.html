    <h1>My H1 is my title</h1>
    <p>Hello, Class! My name is David. This is block is surrounded by paragraph tags. Paragraphs are a block <br>level element.</p>
    <p>However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new block of text, but they state that there <br> 
        is a meaning change. For example, <strong>this text is emphasized by making it bold</strong>. Sometimes we may <br>
        choose to emphasize other text by <i>italicizing it</i> or <u>underlining it</u>.</p>
     <h2>My Lists. This is an H2 header; it is a subheading underneath H1.</h2>
     <h3>Unordered Lists (h3 heading)</h3>
     <p>We can also make lists. Here is an example of a bulleted (unordered) grocery list:</p>
         <ul> 
             <li>Apples</li><li>Milk</li><li>lettuce</li><li>Cereal</li></ul>
        <h3>Ordered Lists (h3 heading)</h3>
        <p>Or sometimes I want to make a list, but it is numbered (ordered list) instead. For example, the first three <br>
            things I need to do today, in order are:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Brush teeth</li>
            <li>Eat breakfast</li>
            <li>Take child to preschool</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Links (h2 heading)</h2>
        <p>I can also link to different things. For example, I can go to <a href=https://www.google.com/><span style=color:blue >Google.com</span></a> by going to <a href=https://www.google.com/><span style=color:blue>http://google.com.</span></a><br>
             This s an absolute link because it has the entire URL listed there. If I were to link to somefthing locally on<br>
             my server relative to this file, it would be a relative link. But we'll link to that type of page next time.</p>
        <div>
             <h2>Inline styling with colors (h2 heading)</h2>

         <p>I can also color text using inline styling, but for the most part it is really best to use styling that is done in <br>
            the header or using an external stylesheet. But we will worry about doing that next time. Here I am <br>
            making text <span style=color:green>green</span>, <span style=color:red>red</span>, or <span style=color:blue>blue</span>. It is really easy to insert a new color. There are lots of places to look for <br>
            colors. You could go here <a href=https://www.color-hex.com/><span style=color:purple>color-hex.com</span></a>, for example, at <a href=https://www.color-hex.com/><span style=color:purple>http://www.color-hex.com/</span></a>.</p>
        <p>This is all for now. I made my first page!</p>
